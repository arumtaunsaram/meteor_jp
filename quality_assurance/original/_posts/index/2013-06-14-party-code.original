      I'll call it...

        new suggestion
      
    
    

    Install Meteor (if you haven't already). In your Terminal window, run:
$ curl https://install.meteor.com | sh


    Make a copy of the example.
$ meteor create --example parties


    

    Get it running on the cloud.
$ cd parties
$ meteor deploy .meteor.com
